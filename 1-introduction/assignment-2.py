Task: the student grading program
    Hung is teaching a small class and they just had a test.
    He has already graded the papers on the scale of 100 but in Finland grades are on scale of 5.
    Can you write a program that helps him convert the grade to the Finnish system?
    The program should ask him for his inputs.
    Try to write the program using functions (define your own function and use it)

Extras:
    - If the grade is equal or less than 2, the software would ask Hung whether he wants to call the parent.
    - The software lets him input a list of grades and will tell him the proportion in his class that has grades < 3.
    - His class have 10 students and he would like to know the top 5 grades. (Hung inputs 10 grades, sw tells the best 5)

Ultimate extras:
    - Can the software let him input not only grades but also student names? After inputting the name, he would like to check the grades
    of some students by name as well.
      [
        The complexity of this feature is entirely up to you. 
        If you would like the software to work non-stop, look for while loop. Hint: "while True" or "while condition"
      ]
    - He teaches 2 classes, can the software allow him to input the grades for both classes and print it all out at the end when he types "finish"?
      The print out should  print each class separately with class number / name, and list of students their grades in that class.
      If you can, print out the list of students in alphabetical order.
